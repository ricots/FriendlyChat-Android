# Firebase Codelab: FriendlyChat

## /Android-Starter
This is where I used CodeLab to build a simple chat app with Firebase as the backend. It includes:
 - Firebase for management of users and their messages
 - Google Authorization
 - Firebase Realtime Database
 - Ability to receive reengagement notifications if sent by an admin from Firebase
 - Ability to send install invites
 - Firebase analytics, for tracking user flows
 - A banner ad
 - Crash reports via Firebase
 - Support for cloud-based Espresso tests via Firebase Test Lab
